In this work, we investigate the analysis of generators for dynamic graphs, which are defined as graphs whose topology changes over time. We focus on generated graphs whose order (number of nodes) varies over time. We use a concept called “sustainability” to qualify the long-term evolution of dynamic graphs. A dynamic graph is considered sustainable if its evolution does not result in a static, empty, or periodic graph. To illustrate how the analysis can be conducted, a parameterized and probability-based generator, named D3G3 (Degree-Driven Dynamic Geometric Graphs Generator), has been introduced in a recent work. From this model, we derive multiple scenarios that correspond to three trends in graph order evolution. Our central contribution lies in a mathematical framework that provides an expectation of the order of the graph at time step , given its order at time step t. Nevertheless, our analysis underscores the challenge of characterizing the sustainability of dynamic graphs, even when a formal mathematical model for graph order evolution is known.
