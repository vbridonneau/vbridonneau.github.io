## Academic Background

- üéì **PhD in Computer Science** (2020‚Äì2024)  
  Universit√© Le Havre Normandie ‚Äì LITIS Laboratory  
  *Thesis: Generation and Analysis of Dynamic Graphs*
  Supervised by Fr√©d√©ric Guinand and Yoann Pign√©  
  Link to [thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04888896).

- üéì **Engineering Degree in Computer Science** (2017‚Äì2020)  
  ENSEIRB-MATMECA, Bordeaux INP, France  
  *Specialization: High-Performance Computing & Parallel Applications Verification*  

During my engineering studies, I interned at **INRIA Bordeaux** and the **Innovative Computing Laboratory (ICL), University of Tennessee, USA**, working on fault tolerance, MPI, and program verification in HPC contexts.

## Research Profile

My doctoral research focused on **temporal and dynamic graphs**, used to model evolving complex systems such as social or biological networks.  
I proposed two original metrics:  

- **Sustainability**: to assess whether a dynamic graph remains non-trivial (not empty or periodic) over time.  
- **DynamicScore**: a novel way to quantify structural changes in evolving graphs.  

These contributions were published in **Applied Network Science** and leading international conferences (*Complex Networks & Their Applications*, *SAND*, *FRCCS*).  
My broader interests include:  

- Complex networks and temporal graphs  
- Metrics for network dynamics  
- High-performance computing (MPI, checkpointing, parallelism)

## Teaching Experience

Since 2022, I have been teaching at **Universit√© Le Havre Normandie** as a PhD student and later as a **Research and Teaching Assistant (ATER)**.  
I have designed and delivered courses for Bachelor students in:  

- Algorithms and programming (Java, Processing)  
- Operating systems (C, Bash)  
- Python programming  
- Digital literacy (PIX certification)  

In addition, I developed online teaching resources such as a [GitHub course wiki on Operating Systems](https://github.com/vbridonneau/CoursSysteme/wiki).
