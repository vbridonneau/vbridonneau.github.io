## Description
The aim of this course is to teach first- and second-year undergraduate students the basics of programming and algorithms. The languages used in this course are Java and Processing. During these classes, the programming concepts studied are procedural programming and object-oriented programming. The algorithmic concepts covered include algorithmic time complexity and concepts such as linked lists. During these classes, I used online materials written by a colleague. During the sessions, I would cover some theory to explain the basic concepts, then we would do the exercises in the materials to apply the newly introduced concepts.
