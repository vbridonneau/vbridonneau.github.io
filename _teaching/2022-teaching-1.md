## Description
This course covers the basics of operating systems. The languages
used are C (for threads, processes, memory management, etc.) and bash (for the working environment). The concepts introduced in this course relate to the functioning of an operating system.
Students learn how to use system calls, create and manipulate processes and threads, and manipulate a working environment (bash commands, environment variables, and special files, in particular).
As part of these courses, I taught lectures. During the second year, I wrote online course and lab materials that can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/vbridonneau/CoursSysteme/wiki)
