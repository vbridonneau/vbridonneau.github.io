This study introduces a new metric called “DynamicScore”
to evaluate the dynamics of graphs. It can be applied to both vertices
and edges. Unlike traditional metrics, DynamicScore not only measures
changes in the number of vertices or edges between consecutive time
steps, but also takes into account the composition of these sets. To il-
lustrate the possible contributions of this metric, we calculate it for in-
creasing networks of preferential attachment (Barab´asi-Albert model)
and Edge-Markovian graphs. The results improve our understanding of
the dynamics inherent in these generated evolving graphs.
