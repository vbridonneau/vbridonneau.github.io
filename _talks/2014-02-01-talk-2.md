An information is present in a dynamic graph at time $0$. According to a chosen communication scheme, is this information still present at time $T$ in the graph despite a change in the set of vertices over time? This preliminary work proposes a formal description of this problem and some of its variants.
It is shown that for simple cases a polynomial time algorithm can answer the question while remaining open for more complex variants.
